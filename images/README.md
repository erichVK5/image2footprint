Images showing a workflow starting with colour extracts from a dithered three colour image; a dog in black (silkscreen), brown (fibreglass substrate) and white (soldermask).

The layouts exported with square pixels from image2footprint are imported into pcb-rnd and placed in the appropriate layers.

The layout is exported from pcb-rnd as an openscad layout, specifiying the silkscreen and soldermask colours in the export dialogue to match the intended manufacturing colours.
